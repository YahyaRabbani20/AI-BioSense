## Overview  
Monitoring blood glucose is critical for diabetes management, yet conventional methods can be invasive, imprecise, or inconvenient.  
This project introduces an **AI-enhanced framework** to design and optimize single-stranded DNA-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotube (ssDNA-SWCNT) optical biosensors for glucose detection.

Our pipeline combines **unsupervised clustering**, **deep neural networks**, and **pattern recognition** to systematically explore the vast DNA sequence space and predict optimal sequences for selective and sensitive glucose response. This hybrid approach couples **in silico intelligence** with **experimental validation** to accelerate the discovery and refinement of high-performance biosensors.

## AI & Machine Learning Highlights  
-  **Clustering Algorithms**: Efficiently partitioned thousands of ssDNA sequences to explore diversity and reduce lab workload.  
- **K-mer & Positional Pattern Recognition**: Extracted and interpreted structural DNA motifs linked to sensor responsiveness.  
- **Deep Learning Architecture**:
  - **GCNs**: Captured nucleotide interactions and chemical context.
  - **GNNs**: Modeled DNA relationships and sequence dynamics.
  - **CNNs**: Identified local motifs and critical subsequences for detection response.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Proposed high-response DNA sequences with high accuracy.  
- **Active Learning Loop**: Combined model predictions with experimental feedback to continuously improve sensor design.
